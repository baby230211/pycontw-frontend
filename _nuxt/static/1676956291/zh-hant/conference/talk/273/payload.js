What is declarative UI?\r\n2. Trend of cross-platform declarative UI frameworks in other languages\r\n3. Currently available frameworks with declarative UI support for Python \r\n4. Why there is no declarative UI framework for Python written in Python\r\n5. Introduce a tiny Pure Python Declarative UI Framework https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fi2y\u002Fcastella\r\n\r\nAfter listening to this talk, as a result, you will know what declarative UI looks like and a UI framework in which you can try it out. This talk may be able to provide you the opportunities as following:\r\n- To know some wrappers for UI frameworks written in other languages available in Python.\r\n- To get a little bit piece of the history of UI frameworks (GUI toolkits).\r\n- To know a case used python's Protocol (type hint) well.";a.slide_link="https:\u002F\u002Fspeakerdeck.com\u002Fi2y\u002Fa-cross-platform-pure-python-declarative-ui-framework";a.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F6hwvUTKaQq92f3iAXhUbJf";a.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FSkeZvTX1j";a.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F0c\u002F87\u002F0c87b2f4c05ba22d87c34a059683c2cc.jpg",name:"Yasushi Itoh",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fi2y",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fi2y_",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Hi, I'm a software engineer at Mercari inc. in Japan.
