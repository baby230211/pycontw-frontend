It uses a user-friendly API for defining and training neural networks. It provides stable Python APIs and embraces the style and ergonomics of the Python language. The goal of this talk is to help developers get familiar with this end-to-end platform. To do so, we're going to build an Image Assessment application, TasteGram, completely from scratch all using Python.";b.detailed_description="For this talk, we're going to take a top-down approach and start from the aesthetic data. Here, I'll talk about some useful ways of how to preprocess the dataset out of Keras Preprocessing released this year.\r\n\r\nAnd then we'll move on to building and training the model, where we'll get to understand a little bit about how to apply the transfer learning to learn an aesthetic evaluation task. \r\n\r\nFinally, we'll tying all of these pieces together at the bottom level and talk a bit about deploying the model on edge devices.\r\n\r\nThis talk should be pretty helpful for developers to get an idea of how to turn theoretical concepts into working implementations with TensorFlow, and they can develop their own end-to-end ML application all using Python.";b.slide_link="https:\u002F\u002Fbit.ly\u002Fpycon22";b.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F3ovdbifBx8hXaoWD8EgcxX";b.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FBJcR8pmki";b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F6c\u002Fcb\u002F6ccbefb8869fc9ecf50f12377e4f2c57.jpg",name:"John Lu",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Flush93gh",twitter_profile_url:a,facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"John is an Android Developer at Seekrtech, currently focusing on developing a gamified To-do list app, WaterDo. \r\n\r\nHe is deeply motivated by challenges and tends to be excited by breaking conventional ways of thinking and doing.
