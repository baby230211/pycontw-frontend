For the economic consideration, The PICO gives them friendly prices and creates more flexible things. And it's useful for their life in long-term regard. The technology community is a different environment for them but will play an essential role in inspiring them to change their life.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share my teaching experience of MicroPython combined with technology. I will share a middle school teacher's education case on developing a work, material preparation management, woodworking design, circuit design, and MicroPython writing electromechanical integration. Let the children know the outline of the world's technology and learn Python's practical skills.",detailed_description:"I have watched the problem of the massive disparity between the rich and the poor globally for many years. And I decided to resign from my position in the technology industry for many years and came directly to teach.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher in the middle school in the rural and remote areas, I can be closer to the student and help them more. I hope they get more opportunities in the future through current technology education. And I found that the tools and materials used in science and technology education are often costly and cannot teach valuable things.\r\n\r\nHere I want to share my actual case, how to use Raspberry Pi PICO, and some of my methods. To make science and technology education at a relatively low cost, I hope that everyone who pays attention to this issue around the world can have more choices and inspiration.",slide_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.canva.com\u002Fdesign\u002FDAEyq1KSIoE\u002FtnOz5wAsPUfuf_IEdTcUBw\u002Fview?utm_content=DAEyq1KSIoE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton",slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002FtAUZ1kB7EQJbQpbCvsvTse",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FSkcqIpQko",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fea\u002Fed\u002Feaed68f347326efe2c937641ceec1f5b.jpg",name:"Milo Chen",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fmilochen0418",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fmilochen0418",facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fmilochen0418",bio:"In my achievement, I did LinkedIn 100,000+ followers(2017), Intel Award(2018), Stack overflow ranking top 1k~2k(2021), PyCon talk WebRTC(2021).\r\nMy first time in to use Python 2.0 was in 2002. I used it to write TCP\u002FIP programs. I have majored in law, electronics, and computer science. I like to be constantly exposed to new knowledge and new areas.\r\n--\r\nI have made contributions to product innovation in industries such as electronics, automobiles, and medical systems and have served as a senior software engineer, product manager, and architect. Now I'm solving the problem of the global gap between the rich and the poor.\r\n--\r\nCurrently, I work as a science and technology teacher in a rural middle school. Whether it is developing and promoting the Sync Slide open source product (GPL 3) or incubating the Metaversity (Metaverse University) ecosystem, these are all strategies to solve the gap between the rich and the poor in the world. Because I want to improve the world's human gap."}],event_type:"talk"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]});
