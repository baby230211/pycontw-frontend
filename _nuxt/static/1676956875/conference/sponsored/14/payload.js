However, there will be cases you want to provide raw data to 3rd party but you donâ€™t want to grant them directly access to your private GCP project. In this talk, we will walk through how we can use BigQuery streaming client to pull high volume of data from BigQuery efficiently. Afterwards, we will combine it with Pub\u002FSub streaming client to trigger the downloading job together to achieve the goal of continuous data exporting",slide_link:a,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F99HovY4yo4krtEvBfDdYr5",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FHyxfwpmyi",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fcc\u002F44\u002Fcc44e9d3d863fe6dc0566cc87561db08.jpg",name:"YungChunLu",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fyungchunlu",twitter_profile_url:a,facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Yung-Chun works a Senior Data engineer in Micron, a leading producer of computer memory and storage solutions, to build intelligent data services to improve the manufacturing processes."}],location:"4-r0-1",begin_time:"2022-09-04T04:45:00Z",end_time:"2022-09-04T05:15:00Z",event_type:"sponsored",youtube_id:a}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("")));
