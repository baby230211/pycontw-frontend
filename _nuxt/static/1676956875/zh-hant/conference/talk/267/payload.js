Python plays a vital role in maximizing the value a person can get from geodata. This talk will provide a short background on how a geo* scientist works and will tackle some of the Python libraries being used in the geo* space from reading\u002Fwriting data, and visualization to the different workflows.";a.detailed_description="The talk will introduce how python is being used in the geo space; from reading and writing geo data, processing, and visualization. It will discuss some geo python libraries like Geopandas and Rasterio which deals in reading and writing, and contains a pre-processing toolkit in geoscience; Geopandas and your typical Numpy operations which handles the processing component. Folium which works well in displaying geo data. \r\n\r\nThis talk will also go through some geo algorithms and workflows like land use classification, site analysis, and traffic management which are real world applications.\r\n\r\nHopefully listeners and attendees of this talk will be able to learn how to integrate and use geo data in their applications and systems.";a.slide_link="https:\u002F\u002Fdrive.google.com\u002Ffile\u002Fd\u002F1X_P_UvBk8QJ6AotiKxzdoPFHvyTvUiQQ\u002Fview?usp=sharing";a.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F9qy5UM2SXJx9q3ZnFWhK3Z";a.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FBka1vT7Jo";a.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fdd\u002Fb9\u002Fddb92795a8f823678fd332a357e2102e.jpg",name:"Ian Panganiban",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Flkpanganiban",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Flkpanganiban",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Ian is currently leading the team of engineers at Iraya Energies in optimizing the cloud infrastructure for development, data processing, and data retrieval at its forefront.
