This talk will discuss how we further it by utilizing markup processors as extensions and generate more effective documentation. This will be also further elaborated on through a case study showcasing how integrating the documentation can improve the overall benefit towards a project and mistakes to avoid while attempting the integration.",detailed_description:"Documentation is often something developers find tedious and are not exactly enthusiastic about. However, it can be approached very differently; and with this talk, I will able to shed light on the exciting part of documentation with the creation of extensions; in particular over Sphinx. The benefits of Sphinx has been evident to many developers. It has helped in being able to create documentation for our services and put it in such a way that our users and fellow developers enjoy the experience. However, there is so much more to take away from Sphinx than is available from the functionalities that most developers utilize it for, and it all starts with defining our own extensions for it.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss the best practices in creating extensions for Sphinx and the benefits it provides users and developers in doing so. This will include how to plan, structure, and catch cases of errors that may come with the extension, as well as specific practices such as with documenting links, references, and in documenting considerations with extensions. This will also include highlighting the current trends in the development of extensions up to this point, and how hierarchy in documentations is being established and structured as a result of this. I will also mention some key points to consider, including making the documentation accessible and managing it as part of the code repository.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the talk, I will demonstrate this by through a demonstration coupled with talking through a case study of how my own extension works with Sphinx with its purpose of documenting a custom class type and how I am able to derive benefits from it to better the experience of my users and fellow developers. Users will leave this talk feeling ready to put into practice making new extensions as discussed in this talk as part of their SDLC.",slide_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fspeakerdeck.com\u002Frenaldigondosubroto\u002Fenhancing-documentations-on-sphinx-with-the-power-of-sphinx",slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F2odhKfnXyV33Y4yCPDsZdb",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FB1nqUTQ1s",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fe4\u002F25\u002Fe42592d659062d1c07211a1416dc0353.jpg",name:"Renaldi Gondosubroto",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Frenaldig",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FRenaldig",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Renaldi Gondosubroto is the Project Lead of GReS Studio, a company that promotes the concept of the Internet of Things by creating solutions for problems around the community while utilizing the concept.
