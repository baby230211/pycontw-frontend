Some of these has been tested on Python and it works. Shall the Python and open-source communities be concerned?";c.detailed_description="### Background:\r\n\r\nAfter researchers at the University of Cambridge published [a paper](https:\u002F\u002Ftrojansource.codes\u002Ftrojan-source.pdf) about a malicious attack named Trojan Source, which exploited the fact that some program interpreters, like CPython, can handle Unicode. This has caused concerns in the open-source community about the malicious contribution that looks totally legitimate in human eyes but contain invisible attacks. As a member of the Python community, we should all be aware of that and understand how we can prevent this attack to happen.\r\n\r\n### About this talk:\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Cheuk will decode the finding in this paper to a level that can be understood by everyone. She will start with a joke example who you can mess up someone by using Unicode. She will then explain what is Unicode and why it causes trouble. Afterwards, she will explain the [Python examples](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fnickboucher\u002Ftrojan-source\u002Ftree\u002Fmain\u002FPython) in the paper and why it can be dangerous. Lastly, she will open up a discussion on how we should defend ourselves from those attacks and what we can do as a community.";c.slide_link=b;c.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F1KMf9S167YGfLtQPu3hxLv";c.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FryO9Amwki";c.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Ffb\u002Fe0\u002Ffbe015320d555add14d79fc6f39c1aac.jpg",name:"Cheuk Ting Ho",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FCheukting",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcheukting_ho",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Before working in Developer Relations, Cheuk has been a Data Scientist in various companies which demands high numerical and programmatical skills, especially in Python. To follow her passion for the tech community, now Cheuk is the Developer Advocate for Anaconda.\r\n\r\nBesides her work, Cheuk enjoys speaking at various conferences. Cheuk also organises events for developers. Cheuk has organised conferences including EuroPython (of which she is a board member), PyData Global and Pyjamas Conf.
