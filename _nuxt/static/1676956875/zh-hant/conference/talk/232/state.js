Chaos theory is the study of systems that appear random but are completely deterministic, such as the double pendulum. Due to factors such as open-source libraries and an active community, Python has allowed for new machine learning progress for more efficient understanding of chaos theory, particularly with the application of ML models for new perspectives on problems considered “unsolvable”. In this talk, we discuss Python implementations of physics-informed neural networks, PINNs, for chaotic physics scenarios. The key takeaways are a refreshing introduction to the fascinating field of chaos theory and an appreciation for how Python is impacting physics research.",detailed_description:"Python is the language of Machine Learning, functioning as a sort of rosetta stone that links a number of industries to greater efficiency. What are some interesting examples of Python’s impact? In this talk, we show Python progress in Machine Learning has driven new developments in the field of chaos theory, a field studying systems governed by complex differential equations that appear to be random despite actually being deterministic. We begin by offering the necessary context for chaos theory. Then, we discuss implementations of relevant machine learning models in Python, focusing on model architectures such as the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). Specifically, Python enables scientific progress due to several past projects, its open-source libraries (i.e. DeepXDE), an active community, and overall ease-of-use, among other factors. The primary takeaways are a first-hand exposure to the fascinating field of chaos theory and an understanding of how Python is helping drive new changes in age-old problems.",slide_link:a,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F89eWi3M339pEYGWaAtcwac",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002Fryxkv6m1j",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fstatic\u002Fimages\u002Fdefault_head.png",name:"Srivatsa Kundurthy",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsrivatsa-kundurthy",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fsrkundurthy",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Srivatsa Kundurthy is a student based in the Greater New York City Area.
